## Get Access

The New Dashboard shows long lists of sites within seconds, does this other really cool thing, and looks really nice. Want to try it?

Contact [Support](/support) and ask for access to the New Dashboard and the supporting Slack Community.

Once you're added to the project, navigate to your existing Dashboard, and add `beta` between between `pantheon.io` and your [UUID](/glossary#uuid). For example: `pantheon.io/beta/workspace/de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014`. You'll be immediately transported to a blank page on the New Dashboard Workspace. Click **Sites** on the left to get to the Sites view.
